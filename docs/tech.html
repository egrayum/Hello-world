    The turtlekins tech branch is managed by Cuddlekins. He is pretty good at inventing(extreme understatement here.) 
    Cuddlekins is currently working on an electric aorplane for commercial overseas shipping. He is working on test model
    #39af, which will have an upgraded power storage system. He is also experimenting with antimatter as a rocket propellant,
    and is building a particle accelerator that will "hopefully create antihelium. Oh, also, it will hopefully not blow up."
    One of his successful inventions is a machine that creates a vacuum using electromagnetic radiation.
    And he also designed and built a super smart coffee grinder in 2 weeks. And a smart dog food bowl that is easily
    programmable to release certain amounts of food at certain times of day.
    When asked what his key to success is, he says: "Being completely okay when things blow up." In cuddlekins' lab,
    lots of things blow up.
