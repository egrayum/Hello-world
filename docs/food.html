    The turtlekins food branch is managed by Turtle. She comes up with a new recipe every week, and for Turtle there is no
    type of food that she can't cook, though she has a little trouble with macarons and hearty soups like Minestroni.
    She could release a chocolate cake recipe one week, and a phad thai recipe the next. Her cooking expertise has also led
    to the development of several new cooking utensils, such as the "spatula tongs." She is also credited with the 
    invention of the wafflecake-a pancake on one side and a waffle on the other.
